## Introduction
üõë This project is an advanced script for Cloudflare Workers that allows you to route various configurations (VLESS, VMess, Trojan) through Cloudflare's CDN to bypass internet restrictions. Featuring a modern UI and new capabilities such as gRPC support, custom port selection, and a smart IP scanner, this panel provides a comprehensive experience for generating subscription links.

## Installation
üîª1. Sign up or log in to Cloudflare (cloudflare.com), and ensure that you have verified your email.

üîª2. Navigate to the `Workers and Pages` section, then create and name a new worker.

üîª3. Click on `Edit Code` to access the code editing environment.

üîª4. Download or Copy entire content the latest version of the [SezarSec Worker Panel script](https://github.com/SezarSec/SezarSec-Worker-Panel-/releases/tag/worker), and copy the entire content.

üîª5. Paste the content of the script onto the mentioned step 3 javascript editing environment.

üîª6. Click on `Deploy` in the top-right corner (you may need to press Ctrl+S to save first if the Deploy button is not active).

üîª7. Your worker's subscription URL will follow this format: `https://{your_worker_address}.workers.dev/sub/{your_clean_ip}`

## Features
„ÄΩÔ∏è Modern UI: A redesigned, user-friendly management panel.

„ÄΩÔ∏è Multi-Protocol Support: Works with VLESS, VMess, and Trojan protocols.

„ÄΩÔ∏è gRPC & WebSocket: Supports both gRPC and WS transmissions.

„ÄΩÔ∏è Custom Port Selection: Allows you to filter configs by your desired ports.

„ÄΩÔ∏è Smart IP Scanner: A built-in tool to live-scan Cloudflare IPs and find the one with the lowest latency.

„ÄΩÔ∏è Server Health Check: An optional feature to verify that config servers are online.

## How to Use
„ÄΩÔ∏è After deployment, access the management panel by navigating to your worker's main URL.

„ÄΩÔ∏è Quick Method: Click the "Get Quick Link" button to instantly generate a subscription link using a randomly selected clean IP.

„ÄΩÔ∏è Smart Scan Method: Click "Scan Clean IP" to view a list of healthy IPs with their latencies. You can then "Select" the best option to build your link.

„ÄΩÔ∏è The final subscription URL will follow this format: https://{your_worker_address}.workers.dev/sub/{your_clean_ip}. Add this URL to your client.

## Customization
„ÄΩÔ∏è You can easily add or modify the subscription source links by editing the subLinks section at the beginning of the script. Both standard and Base64-encoded links are supported.

## Additional Notes
„ÄΩÔ∏è The panel has a built-in scanner for finding clean IPs, but you can still use IPs found through other scanners.
„ÄΩÔ∏è The base worker URL can fetch clean IPs via [IRCF Space Repo](https://github.com/ircfspace/cf2dns/blob/master/list/ipv4.json), but it's still recommended to use [Scanners](https://ircf.space/scanner.html).
